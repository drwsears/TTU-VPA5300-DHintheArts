### VPA 5300 -- The Digital Humanities in the Arts (Texas Tech University)
### Dr. David Sears, Fall 2021

### Description

This course examines the emerging role played by corpus-driven methods in arts research. To that end, we will complete weekly readings drawn from interdisciplinary fields like corpus linguistics, systematic musicology, and the digital humanities, and students will receive training in corpus-based methods, but no prior background in statistics or programming is required. Assignments will include (1) a collaborative presentation examining the groupâ€™s digital arts reception practices (Digital Reception (Auto)Biographies); (2) creation of an open-access respository of digitzed music, art, or text data (Digital Canons); and (3) a conference proposal and presentation, preferably related to the respository. The latter two assignments may either examine a specific research question pertaining to the digital humanities in the arts, or visualize/sonify digitally encoded data.

This repository includes the Fall 2021 syllabus, lecture notes and slides, and all pertinent materials related to our in-class tutorials, which introduce a few of the more common methods in the Digital Humanities for the study of digitized text (e.g., keyword analysis, sentiment analysis, topic modeling), music (audio feature extraction, key-finding, etc.), and (still or motion) images (e.g., image search and segmentation, mapping, networks, etc.).
